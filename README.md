# Challenge 10 (Phase 3 - Batch 3) - Create Post Blog App

# Description

In this challenge, You will create a post blog app using api that you guys can check the [API DOCUMENTATION HERE](https://blogger-wph-api-production.up.railway.app/api/)
and then implement it to this [UI DESIGN](https://www.figma.com/design/vQHN3uPFiXfm8EYye431jN/Blog--Copy-?node-id=17488-16700&p=f&t=J4ZJzMMU48EI0YNn-0)

Welcome to Challenge 12! After successfully building the foundation of your blog application and integrating it with the API in Challenge 10, it's now time to enhance your application's user experience (UX) and accessibility using Radix UI.

In this challenge, you will continue developing your blog application, focusing on interactive features and forms using Radix UI's unstyled components. This is your opportunity to create feature-rich, accessible-by-default, and easily customizable UI components according to the design.

üéØ Learning Objectives
The main goals of this challenge are to hone your skills in:

- Implementing Interactive UI Components: Building features like forms (Write Post), advanced navigation (Profile Menu), or other interactions using Radix UI primitives.

- Customizing Styling: Applying Tailwind CSS styles to Radix UI components to match existing designs or create new ones.

- Ensuring Accessibility: Understanding and leveraging Radix UI's built-in accessibility features to create an inclusive application.

- API Integration for New Features: Integrating write post and delete post features with the same API.

- Improving UX: Creating a smoother and more interactive user experience.

# Features to Implement

You need to complete your blog application with the following features, using Radix UI:

- Create Post Page (/write or similar):

A form to create new blog posts.

Ensure this form uses relevant Radix UI components (e.g., Dialog for confirmation, DropdownMenu for category selection, Popover for input tooltips, Toast for success/failure notifications).

Integrate with the API to submit new post data.

- Delete Post Functionality:

Add functionality to delete a post (e.g., on the Detail Post page).

Use Radix UI Dialog or AlertDialog components for deletion confirmation.

Integrate with the API to delete data.

- Profile Menu / Dropdown (optional, bonus points):

If there's a profile or user account section, create a dropdown menu for user navigation or actions using Radix UI DropdownMenu.

- Enhancement of Existing Components (optional, bonus points):

Identify areas in your existing Home/Search/Detail pages that can be improved with Radix UI components (e.g., Tooltip for icons, Popover for search filters, etc.).

The goal of this challenge is to assess your ability to:

- Interpret a design from Figma.
- Structure a webpage with Next JS.
- Apply styles using Tailwind CSS.
- Create a responsive layout.
- Integrate your app with provided API
- Deploy your app to vercel

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- Next.js: Application framework.

- Tailwind CSS: Styling.

- Radix UI: Unstyled and accessible UI components.

- Axios & React Query: For API interactions.

- API Documentation: https://blogger-wph-api-production.up.railway.app/api/

- UI Design (Figma): https://www.figma.com/design/vQHN3uPFiFfm8EYye431jN/Blog--Copy-?node-id=17488-16700&p=f&t=J4ZJzMMU48EI0YNJ-0

- Note: The Figma design might not explicitly show Radix UI components. This is your chance to be creative and interpret how Radix UI components can be applied to achieve similar design or functionality with better accessibility.

# üìö Important Resources & References

- Official Radix UI Documentation: https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives

- This is your primary resource. Learn how to install, use, and style components.

- Focus on components like Dialog, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tooltip, Form, Toast, AlertDialog.

- Radix UI with Tailwind CSS Examples: Many online examples and tutorials demonstrate how to combine Radix UI with Tailwind. Search for references if you need styling inspiration.

# üöÄ Getting Started

- Continue from Challenge 10 Project: Use the project you worked on in Challenge 10 as your base.
- Install Radix UI: If you haven't already, install the Radix UI packages you need
- Learn Radix UI Components: Take time to understand how each Radix UI component works, especially the properties and events it provides.
- Implement New Features: Start working on the Create Post page and Delete Post functionality using Radix UI components.
- Styling with Tailwind CSS: Apply Tailwind CSS classes directly to the elements rendered by Radix UI components.

# Evaluation System

- In addition to the general criteria from Challenge 10 (project structure, routing, code quality, deployment), the additional criteria for this Challenge 12 are:

- Radix UI Utilization (40%):

How effectively you use Radix UI components to build the requested features (Create Post, Delete Post, etc.).

Accuracy in using the properties and patterns recommended by Radix UI.

Variety of Radix UI components used (not just one component repeatedly).

- Customization & Styling (30%):

Ability to style Radix UI components using Tailwind CSS to match the design or create an appealing UI.

Visual consistency with existing parts of the application.

- Accessibility (20%):

Whether the components you build are well-accessible (e.g., keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader compatibility). Radix UI helps a lot here, but ensure you don't break it.

Proper use of ARIA attributes if necessary (though Radix UI provides many of these out-of-the-box).

- New Feature API Integration (10%):

Create post and delete post functionalities are correctly connected to the API and work well.

The evaluation for this assignment will be based on the following criteria:

1. Project Structure & App Router Conventions: How you structure your project using the Next.js App Router conventions (e.g., proper use of page.js, layout.js, loading.js, not-found.js, etc.).

2. Routing & Data Fetching: Your ability to implement routing, including dynamic routes ([slug]), and efficiently fetch data from a local API using the appropriate rendering strategies (Server Components for data fetching, Client Components for interactivity).

3. Next.js Feature Utilization: How effectively you use Next.js-specific features for optimization and user experience, such as using the <Image> component for images and implementing custom error handling.

4. Code Clarity & Best Practices: The overall quality and readability of your code. This includes clean code, clear naming for variables and components, and following general React and Next.js best practices.

5. Deployment: Whether the application is successfully deployed to a hosting platform (like Vercel or Netlify) and is fully functional in the live environment.
